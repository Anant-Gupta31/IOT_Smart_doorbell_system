# IOT_Smart_doorbell_system
Through this project, we are trying to achieve a simple, smart doorbell system using Arduino UNO and NodeMCU. Since India is getting inclined towards online shopping and product deliveries, one of the problems that arise is when the product arrives at the doorstep there is no one at home to receive it, or in daily life also it can be considered to be providing a communication gap which sort of is solved by the smart doorbell. Through our doorbell, the owner will receive the notification on his/her smartphone at the exact moment when the bell rings. We have also added a numeric keypad feature for security reasons.
